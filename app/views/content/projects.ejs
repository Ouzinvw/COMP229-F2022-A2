        <p>Honi-Beez is an extremely simple browser game that I created for COMP125, once loaded, a bee will appear on the screen that the user can click on. As the user clicks on more bees, the user will recieve score points, and the bees will iterate their movement faster and faster. Ashamed to say, my highest score was only 25!
        </p>
        <p>
        While designing this game, I had the goal of designing something super minimalistic, but colourful and appeasing to the eyes, and I think I did well in that regard.

      </div>
      <div class="col">
        <h4 class="highlight">Interstellar Image Gallery</h4>
        <p>The interstellar image gallery was another project from COMP125, it's a simple reactive JavaScript gallery that allowed a user to cycle between multiple background images that they could download. There was also an update button used to update the website with pictures recently added to the images folder, using index location.
        </p>
        <p>
        Same with Honi-Beez, I designed the website with simplicity in mind, I figured a website like this isn't designed to keep users on the webpage for very long, so I went with a simple, workable design.

        <h4 class="highlight">GadgeTech</h4>
        <p>GadgeTech, my big boss of projects, this website is designed as a middle-man, connecting the user to a catalogue of related tech items. The website would recieve revenue through referral links to each listed item, as well as a minimal amount of ads. This website was inspired by my early college days, years ago, when I would binge YouTube looking for fun gadgets that I didn't need, to spend my excess tuition money on.
        </p>
        <p>This is still an on-going project, it's not something I expect to complete anytime soon, but it's a passion project, and I work on it whenever I have time or if I get major inspiration.
